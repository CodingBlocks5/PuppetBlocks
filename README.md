## About the Project

Computer programming education in elementary schools in Israel is constantly rising. As most
of the textual programming languages are based on the English language, as well as they have
strict syntax requirements, elementary school student face many difficulties using them. In
order to overcome these challenges, we suggest using a simple visual programming language,
called "PuppetBlocks", for programming an interactive puppet, made by ESP32 micro-controller
and MicroPython firmware. By using Google Blockly library with BIPES platform, such a puppet
can be used for teaching both the concepts of algorithmic thinking and the basics of
programming in Python.

This project is based on a [previous work](https://github.com/BIPES/BIPES), by A. G. D. S. Junior
et. al. (2020). In this work, a framework for website-based visual programming language for
controlling micro-controllers using MicroPython firmware was presented. Please read the paper
for more details about this work:

This work is submitted as the final project in the course "Project in The Internet of Things"
(236333), at The Interdisciplinary Center for Smart Technologies (ICST), Taub Faculty of
Computer Science, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. This project was written by
Orel Adivi `(orel.adivi [at] cs.technion.ac.il)`, Hila Ginzburg
`(hila.gin [at] campus.technion.ac.il)`, and Noy Shmueli `(noyshmueli [at] campus.technion.ac.il)`,
and under the supervision of Assel Aborokn, Tom Sofer, and Itai Dabran, Ph.D. . The work was done in about
an academic semester and is released under GNU General Public License v3.0.
